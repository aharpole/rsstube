Ever wish YouTube provided RSS feeds of your favorite channels' uploads? Turns out, they used to, but early 2014 they dropped the feature.

RSSTube works to fill that gap, allowing you to easily subscribe to an RSS feed of your favorite channels' uploads. Each item in the feed contains an embedded version of the video, allowing you to watch the videos right from your RSS reader, or click through the link to the YouTube video watch page.

You can host this app yourself (it's all set to run on Heroku) or you can just use http://rsstube.net
